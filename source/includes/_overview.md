# Overview

This is the official Todoist API documentation, a reference to the functionality our public API provides, with detailed description of each API endpoint, its parameters, and examples.

**Note that documentation for the older [Todoist API v6](https://developer.todoist.com/v6/) is still available, but we strongly recommend you use or migrate your code to the current version, as the v6 may be deprecated in the near future. You can find a changelog and migration guide at the last section of this documentation.**


## Summary of contents

In the `Getting started` section we will try to present to you the Todoist API, in the simplest possible way, by using real examples, based on common tasks that many users want to accomplish.

After reading this section you should continue with the `Authentication`, in order to learn all the details on the best way to authenticate to our server.

The most important section is the `Sync` section, and you should read it next, where the way that the API works is explained.

The rest sections are the reference documentation of the different Todoist objects and endpoints, and you can continue reading them in the order you need them.
